## Reporting Issues

You need to read and accept the following guidelines in order to report something: [Filter Policy & Issue Tickets](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/wiki/Filter-Policy-&-Issue-Tickets).

**CHEF-KOCH's FilterList maintenance support policy:**

:white_check_mark: The list is **not limited** by English websites only.

:white_check_mark: Porn websites e.g. PornHub is also supported. I don't see any problem in doing this. 

:x: P2P (BitTorrent, etc.) and other copyright infringing, media sharing/streaming websites.

:white_check_mark: Anti-censorship pages.
 
:white_check_mark: Websites containing or related to illegal activity/content. It's up to everyone to use it or not.

:arrow_right: Ensure you checked the [ToDo.md](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/blob/master/ToDo.md) before you submit something.

:arrow_right: **[Report issues, unblocked ads or trackers.](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/issues)**

###### Tips

:bulb: Before you report any problem, make sure that it is in fact [CHEF-KOCH's FilterList](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList) that is causing your issue. Confirm this by temporarily disabling all other installed lists that you may have subscribed including the built in "Tracking Protection" - [or Ads](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/chrome-adblocker) blocking mechanism.

:bulb: Remedy any issues yourself instantly by simply disabling your ad-blocker for the affected website.

:bulb: Rules like `website.com##script:inject(abort-on-property-write.js, uabInject)` are invalid and the Pull Request gets rejected.

:bulb: Check yourself for redundant filter rules, read [here](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/wiki/%5BHow-To%5D-Check-for-redundancies).

:bulb: Every issue ticket which are not giving any specific reproducable steps are getting closed because it's waste of time to talk about certain things over and over again. Make sure you provide so many information that _a three years old child can understand it_. 


## Notes

:grey_exclamation: CHEF-KOCH's FilterList uses the Adblock/uBlock/AdGuard filter syntax and ideally should be used with uBlock, AdGuard etc. for the intended/optimal performance. However, the list can be used with other adblockers that support the filter syntax (these are limited supported due their inefficiency). 

:grey_exclamation: **Untick the "Allow Acceptable Ads" checkbox in Adblock Plus:**

:one: Click on the red "ABP" icon.

:two: Click on "Options".

:three: Untick the "Allow Acceptable Ads" checkbox.

:grey_exclamation: **Still seeing some unblocked ads while using CHEF-KOCH's FilterList?** This is because in some cases I can't have access to certain websites to create ad blocking filters due to those websites having regional/country specific restrictions or require a login account (webmail, social media, etc.).
