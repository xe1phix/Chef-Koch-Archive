Changes to Trusted Certificate Authorities in Android Nougat


Quick overview:
* It's not anymore with N (Nougat) 7.0 that apps can change your device password without special dialogs and warnings + user interactions
* New certificate management via Opt-in, which means only pre-isntalled certs are allowed anymore (Adguard's certificate will still work because you get this Opt-In dialog).
