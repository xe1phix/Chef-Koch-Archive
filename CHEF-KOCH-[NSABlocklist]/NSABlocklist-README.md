Description
------------

This isn't yet another [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) or [DNSBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL) that claims to secure the web, it's specially designed to _stop_ known NSA / GCHQ / C.I.A. or F.B.I. servers from being connecting to you without permission, of course the IPs also can be used for Bot Revolt or other tools. The list is not designed to block common malware, spyware/ads or anything that is already available on the net via a proper designed hosts for such special case. This hosts or the super ranges lists could block some of your sites/servers you may need, so you'll be warned!


My list is original based on 2007 published Wikileaks documents and includes my own modifications from 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2015.


**Current Status**: 2,45 Mio files (not everything upload [yet]). I need to wait for GitHub approval in order to bulk upload bigger file set (100MB+ files).


Mass surveillance is official illegal
------------

According to EGMR [mass surveillance is now official against human rights](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22documentcollectionid2%22:[%22GRANDCHAMBER%22,%22CHAMBER%22],%22itemid%22:[%22001-186048%22]}). 


**You still can help [keep the fight up](https://www.privacynotprism.org.uk/) against any surveillance programs!**




NSA has stopped collecting location data from US cellphones without a warrant
------------

[Intelligence agencies stopped the practice last year](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965354/nsa-intelligence-no-warrant-phone-location-data-collection).



This project includes
------------

* A '[HOSTS](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/HOSTS)' file that includes all Servers/DNS domains that are known to be involved in spying. The confirmation is given within the _Research_ link(s) at the bottom and with my own tests.
* An '[Super Ranges.txt](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/Super%20Ranges.txt)' file which includes a list of known IP ranges that are compromised (be careful with that!).
* An '[LICENSE](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/LICENSE)' File to shows the MIT license.
* The '[README](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/README.md)' (this) file that includes the latest news, updates and explanations,...
* An '[problematic.txt](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/blob/master/problematic.txt)' file which includes DNS/PTRs that are possible problematic for you. 
* The 'Mail.txt' file in case you want to speak with me over encrypted email.
* An 'test' folder for IPv6 only domains. It also contains an 'html' folder for html formatted entries, an 'onion' folder for suspect or faked .onions and an 'Tor' folder for a quick guide how to run an non-exit relay in around 10 minutes.
* The 'References.txt' which contains relevant information about spying or additional topics which may related to reveal surveillance.
* Under the [release page](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NSABlocklist/releases) you will find complete collections/dumps.
* Information on hardware based attacks. 


Any problems, questions or something wrong?
------------

* Feel free to open an issue ticket and I will look at it asap. 


Pull requests or ideas are in general always welcome!


Important Notice
------------

* I do not accept donations in this project, I'm not doing this because I want money, I'm doing this because I didn't found a proper list on the entire Internet and of course I want to share my knowledge with everyone for free. I always think that such information should be available for everyone on the world.
* The project has no political orientation, there will be no political leaks/information since this is not the main mission here.
* Please keep in mind that updates/encryption/knowledge is our _only real_ weapon against NSA and other agencies. The more you know the better you can build strategies and new systems to defeat mass surveillance.
* Please keep in mind that links to e.g. videos aren't valid because there (in most cases) doesn't include a source, date or author. Any information without proper research in it will automatically rejected and labeled as 'invalid' since it's impossible to verify if it's a legimate leak or not. 



Do you hate the NSA or other agencies?
------------

* I do not _hate_ the NSA or other agencies but I really don't like that everyone is automatically under the microscope (mass surveillance) and of course that there is no 'opt-out' or transparency except lies and more lies (and some excuses ...yeah, we are doing this because terrorism, go f$ck yourself with such statements!)
* Everyone have something to hide, passwords, private data, accounts, other meta-data, [...]



Known problems
------------

* An HOSTS file is no guarantee that if the NSA is already 'in your system/network' - to protect you - it's just too late.
* HOSTS files are no guarantee that NSA or any other attacker/organization could simply bypass it via 0day or other vulnerabilities on your system/router.
* HOSTS files can't protect against attacks directly in hardware, e.g. if the router is already compromised or comes with backdoors this list will be easily bypassed anyway.
* Due the complex of the entire file I can't explain every single IP/Domain/PTR record. If something was changed, feel free to open a pull request or send me an eMail.
* The HOSTS file may present an attack vector for malicious software because the file could be modified to redirect the entire traffic e.g. adware/trojans can do this. Ensure that the file was marked as read-only and you're not logged in as administrator.
* Trace-route analysis especially on IPv4 networks are sometimes outdated (due the mass of requests).
* Be careful when blocking IP addresses, as IP addresses change frequently and can block people you don't intend to block.
* **NSA and other agencies can spy on traffic directly from supercomputers like infamous Echelon connected directly to some backbone without revealing any IP. This is an common problem, only strong and proper implemented encryption helps.**
