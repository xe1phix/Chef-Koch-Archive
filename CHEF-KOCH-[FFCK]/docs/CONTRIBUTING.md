# Contributing to FFCK

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to FFCK!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on my [Discord Channel](https://discord.me/CHEF-KOCH).

The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, however keep in mind that I'm often busy, so quality over quantity! Take your time, reproduce your problem and then start a good issue ticket (_see below how_).

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in FFCK? Have a feature request? Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

Can you recreate the issue even after disabling all extensions and with a fresh FF profile?

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/CEF-KOCH/FFCK/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/CEF-KOCH/FFCK/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of Firefox

* Your operating system

* List of extensions that you have installed

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring (**ONLY IF IT'S HELPFUL**)


### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

* [ ] Does the issue only occur with the user.js or is it a Firefox bug

Don't feel bad if the I can't reproduce the issue right away. I typically will simply ask for more information if more is needed!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking workflow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.

## Automated Issue Management

We use a bot to help us manage issues. This bot currently:

* Automatically closes any issue marked `needs-more-info` if there has been no response in the past 20 days.
* Automatically locks issues 90 days after they are closed.

If you believe the bot got something wrong, please open a new issue and let us know.
